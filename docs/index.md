# FedEasy: Simplified Federated Learning with Flower and PyTorch

![FedEasy Logo](placeholder-for-logo.png)


FedEasy is an intuitive and powerful Federated Learning framework built on top of Flower and PyTorch. Our goal is to streamline the process of setting up and running federated learning experiments, making advanced machine learning techniques accessible to researchers and developers alike.

## Key Features
- **Flower and PyTorch Integration:** Leverage the strengths of both the Flower framework and PyTorch to create a robust federated learning environment.

- **Configurability:** Customize your federated learning setup using the config.yaml file, which allows you to control data distributions, models, optimizers, training strategies, and more.

- **Extensive Documentation:** Discover detailed explanations of the supported datasets, models, and strategies in the documentation, making it easier to choose the right components for your project.

- **Easy Setup:** Follow a straightforward setup process using Git, Python, pip, and Miniconda to get your federated learning environment up and running.

- **Flexible Deployment:** Run federated learning simulations on a single machine or scale to multiple clients with ease.

- **Performance Metrics:** Save and analyze training results, including accuracy, loss, and time for each round, to track the progress of your federated learning model.

- **Contribution:** Contribute to the repository by enhancing existing features, adding new models or strategies, or improving documentation. Your contributions are welcome and will help make federated learning more accessible to everyone.

> **Note**: While FedEasy is primarily designed for Linux environments, Windows users can also use it with some adjustments.
